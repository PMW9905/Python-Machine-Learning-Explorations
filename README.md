# Python Machine Learning Explorations

The following projects were a part of CS 6375, a Graduate Level Machine Learning Course taken at the University of Texas at Dallas.

Most, if not all machine learning algorithms, we programmed from the ground up.

### Text Classification with Naive Bayes, MCAP, and Logistic Regression
### Netflix Recommendation System 
### K-Means Image Compression
### Tree Classifiers Exploration
### Markov Model Solver
